# MetaboLights



What they write on the website:

> MetaboLights semantic quality is based on various controlled vocabularies and ontologies linking data to existing resources such as [BRENDA](http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/).

> Many ontologies are embedded in the submission form. One of the used ontology is Experimental Factor Ontology ([EFO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo)). Additionally, MetaboLights recommends the use of [Bioportal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/) to find or resolve any ontologies.



For each section of a MetaboLights study they used a pre-defined "recommended ontology". These can be found in the templates [here](https://github.com/EBI-Metabolights/MetaboLights/tree/master/uncompilables/isatabconfigurations/default) inside the `<recommended-ontologies>` tags. I believe you can search outside these too.
